# Design a Turing machine on the input alphabet  that accepts strings
# represented using this Python regular expression that uses back references:
# r'^([de]*)f\1$' For this machine, the final tape output does not matter. You
# will need to modify the tape in order to complete this exercise.

# Starting state is 0, accepting state is 40.
