## Projects

### üé® Color Survey <sup>`Python` `hw1`</sup>

Tabulate the results of a survey where people were asked to vote for their top
three favorite colors. The results of the survey are stored in an input file.
<br/>

[here](/hw1/assignment/Homework%201%20-%20Python%20Color%20Survey.pdf).</sub>

### ‚è±Ô∏è Time Processor <sup>`Python` `hw2`</sup>

A program that parses a string representation of a time and returns them in a
Python data structure (tuple).

### ‚ôªÔ∏è Garbage Collector <sup>`Python` `hw3`</sup>

Simulation of a Mark-and-Sweep Garbage Collector with Variables, Pointers, and
Heap blocks.
<br/>
<sub>More information can be found
[here](/hw3/assignment/Homework%203%20-%20Python%20Garbage%20Collector.pdf).</sub>

### ‚ôæÔ∏è F# Exercises <sup>`F#` `hw4`</sup>

A collection of functions written in `F#` ‚Äî a functional programming language.
Featuring tail recursion, pattern matching, and discriminated unions.

**Max Cylinder Volume**

Takes in a list of floating-point tuples that represent dimensions of a cylinder
and returns the volume of the cylinder that has the largest volume. Uses tail
recursion.

**Eliminate Consecutive Duplicates**

Takes in a list of integers and eliminates consecutive duplicates; replacing
them with a single instance of the value. Order is preserved and non-
consecutive duplicates are unaffected. Uses tail recursion.

**Binary Search Tree**

An implementation of a binary search tree with `insert`, `search`, and `count`
using a discriminated union.

### ‚ûó Algebraic Simplifier <sup>`F#` `hw5`</sup>

Simplifies an algebraic expression with recursion, pattern matching, and a
discriminated union. Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and
division.
<br/>

[here](/hw5/assignment/Homework%205%20-%20F#%20Algebraic%20Simplifier.pdf).</sub>

### üëå Regular Expressions and Deterministic Finite State Automata (DFA) <sup>`Python` `hw6`</sup>

- Simple Python regular expressions
- Deterministic Finite State Automata for accepting/rejecting strings

<sub>More information can be found
[here](/hw6/assignment/Homework%206%20-%20Formal%20Languages.pdf).</sub>

### üé∞ Turing Machines and Context-Free Grammars <sup>`hw7`</sup>

- Context-Free Grammars for accepting/rejecting strings in a defined Regular
  Language
- Turing Machine for accepting/rejecting strings matching a Regular Expression
  with backreferences
- Turing Machine for transforming an input string

<sub>More information can be found
[here](/hw7/assignment/Homework%207%20-%20Turing%20Machines.pdf).</sub>

### üóÉÔ∏è Language Interpreter <sup>`Python` `extra credit`</sup>

A program that parses and executes a script written in a custom scripting
language. This custom scripting language is composed of sequential pipelines
that perform basic operations on data (similar to SQL, Awk, Sqlunk's query
language, etc.). The input data is stored in a CSV file.
